A famous data set on Iris flowers will be used in this project.

The data set contains 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), for a total of 150 samples. The length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters, were measured from each sample.
